# the Stooge
## story behind the Stooge
Have you ever found yourself in a place you need do something quick. Quick, I mean it. No fancy generators, 
Dependency Injections, Composers, Decorators, Proxies, no. Just a few lines of code to make the magic happens. Even 
more, you would like to get back to it after time with no necessary to chase the latest super-fancy version (with 
generators, DI, Composers etc. etc.).

Have you?
I have. Quite often actually, when it comes to REST services. 
So I did create the one-evening framework, the Stooge.

What it does?
It wraps up HTTP service logic around a few classes. That's all. Period. And so it will, nothing more.

## prototype ready
Please note that it was created strictly for prototyping. When I'm looking for real deal in PHP I usually go with 
Slim framework, so you should if you are looking for production-ready product.
When happens I will update the project to production-ready state. Maybe this year.

## why PHP
Oh boy, because it's everywhere. I'm not talking about this fancy VPS, dockerized services. I'm talking about the 
"host-(k)ing" which your client usually comes with. And you know, quite often it is hard to discuss that PHP maybe isn't the 
very best choice for the new Internet gem. Actually I don't mind much, it does the job as any other language.

## but why PHP7
The future is here old man :). Seriously, because the anonymous classes feature :). 
I have done PHP5 compatible version if anyone will request for it I'll share.

## docs?
Check the examples, they should be pretty self-documented. If in trouble, contact with me via GitHub.

## license?
Take and use. I'll be happy if it works for you, drop me a message if you find it helpful.
